# Improvements timeline

Here will posted comparisons across different builds, with reasonable intervals (a few months).
TODO: Ideally there should be a table - a column for each platform (W7, W10, Mac, GTK).

Legend:
- green = test succeeded (success level 3)
- yellow = test succeeded but triggered warning thresholds (success level 2)
- red = test failed (success level 1)
- black = test crashed or hang (success level 0)
- the number of arrows shows improvement in success level from the previous result
- `?` indicates that some screenshots were differing and required manual overview (which for the purpose of this timeline I executed)
